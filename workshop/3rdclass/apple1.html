            <p>The old lighthouse keeper, Silas, squinted at the churning grey sea.  He'd seen a thousand storms lash against the craggy cliffs, but this one felt different, a low, ominous hum vibrating through the very stones of the tower.  A lone gull cried overhead, its mournful call swallowed by the wind's shriek.  Silas adjusted his thick wool cap, his weathered hands gripping the worn brass railing.  He'd been alone for so long, the only company the rhythmic pulse of the lamp and the relentless rhythm of the waves, that the silence between the gusts felt almost deafening.  Tonight, however, the silence felt pregnant with something more, something unseen, somethingâ€¦waiting. </p>
